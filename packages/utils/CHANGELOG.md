# @vega-ui/utils

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ffc52f: `useSelection`: optional `compare` no longer crashes; new `compare` util

  `compare?` was declared optional but invoked unconditionally in `edges`, `isSelected` and `isDisabled` — range selection or `min`/`max` clamping without a user-provided comparator threw `compare is not a function` (while `expand` had a guard, confirming the option was meant to be optional).

  - `@vega-ui/utils` now exports `compare` — a three-way comparator constrained to the new `Comparable` type (`number | string | bigint | Date`), so types with no universal ordering (objects, symbols) are rejected at compile time; covered with unit tests
  - `useSelection` falls back to it when no `compare` is passed, mirroring the existing `equals ?? Object.is` pattern; pass an explicit `compare` for non-primitive key types
  - `expand` no longer silently no-ops without a user comparator
  - empty or `undefined` `selected` no longer produces `undefined` range edges: `edges()` returns `[]`, `isSelected` returns `false` instead of comparing `undefined`
  - `DataGridSelectable` reuses the shared `compare` instead of its own inline duplicate of the same fallback (no behavior change)

### Patch Changes

- 1007aae: Fix broken `main` field in hooks, utils and react-context

  In `@vega-ui/hooks`, `@vega-ui/utils` and `@vega-ui/react-context` the `main` field pointed to `./dist/index.ts` — a file that doesn't exist in `dist/` (the build only outputs `.js` and `.d.ts`). Modern bundlers masked the problem by resolving through the `exports` map, but environments that rely on `main` (Node without conditional exports support, Jest with legacy resolution, ts-node, CDNs like esm.sh) got `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` or tried to parse TypeScript as JS.

  Changes:

  - `main` now points to `./dist/index.js`
  - added `module: "./dist/index.js"` (consistent with `@vega-ui/react`)
  - added the missing top-level `types: "./dist/index.d.ts"` to utils and react-context so resolvers that don't support `exports` can find the type declarations

- 55a8c44: Sync rollup externals with real dependencies

  `vite.config.ts` of icons and utils listed externals manually, including `@vega-ui/helpers` — a package that doesn't exist in the monorepo — plus entries these packages never import (`@floating-ui/react`, `react-remove-scroll`, `@vega-ui/hooks`). Hand-written lists drift from real dependencies; a stray module matching a dead entry would silently produce a broken bundle.

  - **icons**: externals are now derived from `Object.keys(packageJson.dependencies)` + `Object.keys(packageJson.peerDependencies)` (same pattern as `@vega-ui/react` and `@vega-ui/hooks`), so the "don't bundle this" contract always matches the declared dependencies.
  - **utils**: the package has no runtime dependencies at all (React appears only in type imports), so the list is trimmed to the explicit `['react', 'react-dom', 'react/jsx-runtime']` safety net.
  - `resolveJsonModule: true` added to `tsconfig.node.json` of ui/hooks/icons (their vite configs import `package.json`); the empty `tsconfig.node.json` of utils filled in to match the other packages.

## 2.1.1

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8380d3b: Refactor Calendar stack to scroll-snap scrollers (DataGridPickerScroller) and remove react-store based state.

  ## @vega-ui/ui

  ### SnapScroller

  - **BREAKING:** `initialIndex` renamed to `defaultIndex`.
  - **BREAKING:** removed `preserveScroll`.
  - **BREAKING:** removed `onOffset`.
  - Added scroll-snap callbacks:
    - `onScrollSnapChanging?(element, index)`
    - `onScrollSnapChange?(element, index)`

  ### IndexedSnapScroller

  - Keeps offset-based infinite behavior (window `shift()` / `push()`) and optional `preserveScroll`.
  - Supports controlled `index` (scrolls to it when in window; rebuilds window when outside).

  ### DataGrid

  - **BREAKING:** `onMove(e, node, axis, dir)` replaced with `onArrow(e, nextNode, prevNode)`.
  - **BREAKING:** `DataGridApiRef` changed:
    - removed `keyMap`
    - added `scopes: Map<DataGridScope, DataGridCellKey[]>`
  - `DataGridRowGroup` now supports `scope?: DataGridScope` and provides it via context.
  - Cells unregister from the grid on unmount (node cleanup).
  - Active/selection focus flow updated to sync active cell on focus changes.

  ### DataGridPicker

  - Added `DataGridPickerScroller` and `DataGridPickerScrollerContent`.
  - `DataGridPickerScroller` integrates with scroll-snap events to restore/adjust active focus for the current scope.

  ### DayPicker

  - **BREAKING:** DayPicker scrolling is now driven by `DataGridPickerScroller` (instead of IndexedSnapScroller directly).
  - Added period-to-index mapping via reference anchor:
    - `referenceDate?: Date`
    - `getIndexByDate?(year, month)`
    - `getDateByIndex?(index)`
  - Period changes are emitted during scroll via `onScrollSnapChanging`.

  ### YearPicker

  - **BREAKING:** YearPicker scrolling is now driven by `DataGridPickerScroller`.
  - Added year-to-index mapping via reference anchor:
    - `referenceYear?: number`
    - `getIndexByYear?(year, referenceYear)`
  - Layout derives offset from `year` when `offset` is not provided.

  ### Calendar / CalendarBase

  - **BREAKING:** `onYearChange` -> `onChangeYear`
  - **BREAKING:** `onMonthChange` -> `onChangeMonth`
  - Added controlled/uncontrolled view state for navigation:

  - Added year-group navigation controls:
    - `CalendarNextYearGroupButton`
    - `CalendarPrevYearGroupButton`
  - Picker/ESC handling updated (Escape now stops propagation).
  - Period navigation split into:
    - `nextPeriod` / `prevPeriod`
    - `nextYearGroup` / `prevYearGroup`

  ## @vega-ui/hooks

  - **BREAKING:** removed `useStore`, `useControlledStore` (react-store dependency removed).
  - **BREAKING:** removed `useIntersectionObserver`.
  - Added:
    - `useScrollSnap` (snap measurement + `onSnapChanging/onSnapChange`)
    - `useMutationObserver`
    - `useBiMap`
  - `useRefMap` now exposes `removeItemRef`.
  - `useIndexes` updated to support new shifting semantics safely.

  ## @vega-ui/react-store

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- abbdcdc: Add composable calendar picker primitives and index-based snap scroller utilities.

  **New pickers**

  - **`YearPicker`**

    - High-level year selection component built on top of `DataGridPicker<number>`.
    - Supports `single`, `multiple`, and `range` selection modes with `from` / `to` bounds.
    - Provides a default `YearPickerLayout` (configurable `rows`, `cols`, `start`, `offset`).
    - Adds composable primitives:
      - `YearPickerItem`, `YearPickerRow`, `YearPickerRowGroup`
      - `YearPickerScroller`, `YearPickerScrollerContent`, `YearPickerScrollerLayout`
    - Includes helpers like `createYearPickerGrid` for generating year grids.

  - **`MonthPicker`**

    - Wrapper over `DataGridPicker<number>` specialized for month selection.
    - Default active value resolves to the current month.
    - Provides:
      - `MonthPickerLayout` with configurable `rows`, `cols`, `start`, `locale`, `format`
      - `MonthPickerItem`, `MonthPickerRow`, `MonthPickerRowGroup`
      - `MonthPickerScroller`, `MonthPickerScrollerContent`, `MonthPickerScrollerLayout`
    - Adds `createMonthPickerGrid` for building month matrices (e.g. 3×4 year views).

  - **`DayPicker`**
    - Day-level calendar picker built on `DataGridPicker<number>` with default active set to “today” (timestamp).
    - Supports `single` / `multiple` / `range` selection and can respect min/max via `DataGridPicker`.
    - Provides:
      - `DayPickerLayout` with `year`, `month`, `offset`, `includeOverflowDays`, `weekStartsOn`, `rows`, `cols`, `locale`, `format`
      - `DayPickerItem`, `DayPickerRow`, `DayPickerRowGroup`
      - `DayPickerScroller`, `DayPickerScrollerContent`, `DayPickerScrollerLayout`
    - Adds `createDayPickerGrid` to generate month views with optional overflow days and arbitrary week starts.

  **New scroller utilities**

  - **`IndexedSnapScroller`**
    - Extends `SnapScroller` with virtual, index-based paging.
    - Maintains a sliding window of logical page indexes via `useIndexes({ start, startDir, size, shift })`.
    - Automatically shifts the window when scroll reaches edges (`onOffset(-1|1)`).
    - Exposes:
      - `IndexedSnapScroller` component
      - `IndexedSnapScrollerContent` (injects `index` via context)
      - `IndexedSnapScrollerProvider` / `useIndexesSnapScrollerContext` for consuming the current index in custom layouts.

  **Formatting helpers**

  - Add small date-format helpers, suitable for use inside picker layouts:
    - `formatDay(day, month, year, locale?, format?)`
    - `formatMonth(month, locale?, format?)`
    - `formatYear(year, locale?, format?)`

  These additions provide a fully composable calendar system (years, months, days) on top of `DataGridPicker` and `SnapScroller`, while keeping layout and rendering customizable through small, focused primitives.

## 1.12.3

## 1.12.2

## 1.12.1

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 30e9724: This release introduces a complete grid, selection, and scroll system for structured, interactive UIs.
  It combines efficient keyboard navigation, flexible selection logic, and smooth snap scrolling —
  forming the foundation for advanced table, calendar, and picker interfaces.

  📊 `DataGrid`

  `DataGrid` is a focusable, navigable grid that manages keyboard movement and active-cell focus.

  - Supports navigation with Arrow, Home/End, and PageUp/PageDown keys
  - Optional wrap navigation (horizontal, vertical, or both)
  - Configurable rowDelta for page jumps
  - Provides an imperative API (grid, keyMap) for advanced logic
  - Supports excluded or disabled cells that are skipped during traversal
  - Emits onMove events describing direction and axis of movement

  Used as the base for all higher-level grid-based components.

  🧭 `DataGridSelectable`

  `DataGridSelectable` extends DataGrid with a full selection model.

  - Selection modes: "single", "multiple", "range"
  - Keyboard (Shift + Arrows) and pointer-based range selection
  - Optional disabled and bounded ranges (from / to)
  - Fully integrated with the useSelection hook
  - Provides consistent accessibility and state behavior

  Ideal for building interactive tables, lists, and date selectors.

  🎯 `DataGridPicker`

  DataGridPicker builds on DataGridSelectable to enable picking and highlighting items within a grid.

  - Automatically computes rectangular ranges between selected cells
  - Supports highlighting of continuous intervals (start → end)
  - Can be customized with a user-defined resolveRange function
  - Commonly used for date pickers, emoji selectors, or option matrices

  🧱 `SnapScroller`

  `SnapScroller` provides smooth, scroll-snap navigation with full control and callbacks.

  - Optimized for CSS scroll-snap-align behavior
  - Exposes imperative API: next(), prev(), element

  Triggers:

  - onSnap(index) — when snapped item changes
  - onOffset(direction) — when scroll reaches start or end

  Optional preserveScroll restores snapped position after content updates

  Perfect for carousels, paginated lists, or horizontally scrolling pickers.

  🪝 `useSelection` Hook

  `useSelection` is a composable hook for declarative selection management.

  - Supports "single", "multiple", and "range" modes
  - Provides helpers: toggle, expand, isSelected, edges, and more
  - Accepts custom equals, compare, and resolveRange logic

  Used internally by DataGridSelectable and DataGridPicker

  ⚙️ `Grid & Matrix Utilities`

  These low-level utilities power the core grid logic and ensure efficient traversal.

  `grid`

  A high-level controller for navigating 2D layouts:

  - Provides directional movement (before, after, above, below)
  - Handles row and column wrapping
  - Uses Matrix internally for structure and lookup

  `matrix`

  A modular 2D data engine with the following components:

  `Matrix` — manages all rows and cells
  `MatrixRow` — ordered row container with iterable access
  `MatrixNode` — represents a single cell ([row, col], key, payload)
  `MatrixIndexes` — maintains sorted indices with binary search

  Together, they ensure fast lookups and navigation across sparse grids.

  This release establishes the foundation for interactive, accessible, and performant grid-based interfaces in Vega UI —
  enabling developers to build pickers, calendars, tables, and carousels with minimal boilerplate and maximum control.
