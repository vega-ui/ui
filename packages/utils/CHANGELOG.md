## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- a387fda: Added new calendar primitives:

  - **BaseCalendar** — foundational layout and styling provider for all calendar components (size, variant, compact mode).
  - **Calendar** — high-level fully interactive calendar with day/month/year pickers, scroll-based navigation, controlled/uncontrolled selection modes, and full provider-based state management.

  These components form the new core of the calendar system and enable building flexible, Radix-style declarative/imperative calendar interfaces.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- abbdcdc: Add composable calendar picker primitives and index-based snap scroller utilities.

  **New pickers**

  - **`YearPicker`**

    - High-level year selection component built on top of `DataGridPicker<number>`.
    - Supports `single`, `multiple`, and `range` selection modes with `from` / `to` bounds.
    - Provides a default `YearPickerLayout` (configurable `rows`, `cols`, `start`, `offset`).
    - Adds composable primitives:
      - `YearPickerItem`, `YearPickerRow`, `YearPickerRowGroup`
      - `YearPickerScroller`, `YearPickerScrollerContent`, `YearPickerScrollerLayout`
    - Includes helpers like `createYearPickerGrid` for generating year grids.

  - **`MonthPicker`**

    - Wrapper over `DataGridPicker<number>` specialized for month selection.
    - Default active value resolves to the current month.
    - Provides:
      - `MonthPickerLayout` with configurable `rows`, `cols`, `start`, `locale`, `format`
      - `MonthPickerItem`, `MonthPickerRow`, `MonthPickerRowGroup`
      - `MonthPickerScroller`, `MonthPickerScrollerContent`, `MonthPickerScrollerLayout`
    - Adds `createMonthPickerGrid` for building month matrices (e.g. 3×4 year views).

  - **`DayPicker`**
    - Day-level calendar picker built on `DataGridPicker<number>` with default active set to “today” (timestamp).
    - Supports `single` / `multiple` / `range` selection and can respect min/max via `DataGridPicker`.
    - Provides:
      - `DayPickerLayout` with `year`, `month`, `offset`, `includeOverflowDays`, `weekStartsOn`, `rows`, `cols`, `locale`, `format`
      - `DayPickerItem`, `DayPickerRow`, `DayPickerRowGroup`
      - `DayPickerScroller`, `DayPickerScrollerContent`, `DayPickerScrollerLayout`
    - Adds `createDayPickerGrid` to generate month views with optional overflow days and arbitrary week starts.

  **New scroller utilities**

  - **`IndexedSnapScroller`**
    - Extends `SnapScroller` with virtual, index-based paging.
    - Maintains a sliding window of logical page indexes via `useIndexes({ start, startDir, size, shift })`.
    - Automatically shifts the window when scroll reaches edges (`onOffset(-1|1)`).
    - Exposes:
      - `IndexedSnapScroller` component
      - `IndexedSnapScrollerContent` (injects `index` via context)
      - `IndexedSnapScrollerProvider` / `useIndexesSnapScrollerContext` for consuming the current index in custom layouts.

  **Formatting helpers**

  - Add small date-format helpers, suitable for use inside picker layouts:
    - `formatDay(day, month, year, locale?, format?)`
    - `formatMonth(month, locale?, format?)`
    - `formatYear(year, locale?, format?)`

  These additions provide a fully composable calendar system (years, months, days) on top of `DataGridPicker` and `SnapScroller`, while keeping layout and rendering customizable through small, focused primitives.

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 30e9724: This release introduces a complete grid, selection, and scroll system for structured, interactive UIs.
  It combines efficient keyboard navigation, flexible selection logic, and smooth snap scrolling —
  forming the foundation for advanced table, calendar, and picker interfaces.

  📊 `DataGrid`

  `DataGrid` is a focusable, navigable grid that manages keyboard movement and active-cell focus.

  - Supports navigation with Arrow, Home/End, and PageUp/PageDown keys
  - Optional wrap navigation (horizontal, vertical, or both)
  - Configurable rowDelta for page jumps
  - Provides an imperative API (grid, keyMap) for advanced logic
  - Supports excluded or disabled cells that are skipped during traversal
  - Emits onMove events describing direction and axis of movement

  Used as the base for all higher-level grid-based components.

  🧭 `DataGridSelectable`

  `DataGridSelectable` extends DataGrid with a full selection model.

  - Selection modes: "single", "multiple", "range"
  - Keyboard (Shift + Arrows) and pointer-based range selection
  - Optional disabled and bounded ranges (from / to)
  - Fully integrated with the useSelection hook
  - Provides consistent accessibility and state behavior

  Ideal for building interactive tables, lists, and date selectors.

  🎯 `DataGridPicker`

  DataGridPicker builds on DataGridSelectable to enable picking and highlighting items within a grid.

  - Automatically computes rectangular ranges between selected cells
  - Supports highlighting of continuous intervals (start → end)
  - Can be customized with a user-defined resolveRange function
  - Commonly used for date pickers, emoji selectors, or option matrices

  🧱 `SnapScroller`

  `SnapScroller` provides smooth, scroll-snap navigation with full control and callbacks.

  - Optimized for CSS scroll-snap-align behavior
  - Exposes imperative API: next(), prev(), element

  Triggers:

  - onSnap(index) — when snapped item changes
  - onOffset(direction) — when scroll reaches start or end

  Optional preserveScroll restores snapped position after content updates

  Perfect for carousels, paginated lists, or horizontally scrolling pickers.

  🪝 `useSelection` Hook

  `useSelection` is a composable hook for declarative selection management.

  - Supports "single", "multiple", and "range" modes
  - Provides helpers: toggle, expand, isSelected, edges, and more
  - Accepts custom equals, compare, and resolveRange logic

  Used internally by DataGridSelectable and DataGridPicker

  ⚙️ `Grid & Matrix Utilities`

  These low-level utilities power the core grid logic and ensure efficient traversal.

  `grid`

  A high-level controller for navigating 2D layouts:

  - Provides directional movement (before, after, above, below)
  - Handles row and column wrapping
  - Uses Matrix internally for structure and lookup

  `matrix`

  A modular 2D data engine with the following components:

  `Matrix` — manages all rows and cells
  `MatrixRow` — ordered row container with iterable access
  `MatrixNode` — represents a single cell ([row, col], key, payload)
  `MatrixIndexes` — maintains sorted indices with binary search

  Together, they ensure fast lookups and navigation across sparse grids.

  This release establishes the foundation for interactive, accessible, and performant grid-based interfaces in Vega UI —
  enabling developers to build pickers, calendars, tables, and carousels with minimal boilerplate and maximum control.
